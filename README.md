# Top-Cities-Scraper
Python scraper to collect data from Wikipedia about the top cities in the United States. BeautifulSoup is user for scraping.

I have used BeautifulSoup, which is available for Python 2.7 and Python 3. For running this scraper you need to have Python installed in your system. If environment is already set up then you just need to run the file and CSV file with all the information of Cities will be created at respective path. If environment is not setup yet, kindly go through EnvirnmentSetup document provided in the repository.
